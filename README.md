# ImageSearch

Script collection I use privately to make my photos searchable. Features/plans:

* Face identification (in development)
* Image quality (planned)
* Import data to Elasticsearch (planned)

Currently existing scripts:

* imagefaces.py: Generate face location and encoding information as JSON files.
